# Python CLI Applications

Exploring Python command-line interface (CLI) packages with example applications.


There are several available packages for building CLI applications in Python.

* [Argparse](https://docs.python.org/3/library/argparse.html)
* [Click](https://click.palletsprojects.com/)
* [Typer](https://github.com/tiangolo/typer)
* [Python Fire](https://github.com/google/python-fire)
* [Prompt Toolkit](https://github.com/prompt-toolkit/python-prompt-toolkit)
* [Cement](https://github.com/datafolklabs/cement)
* [Cliff](https://github.com/openstack/cliff)
* [Plac](https://github.com/ialbert/plac)

In this project, we are going to build a CLI tool to manage passwords of different applications, i.e. `skcli`. This tool will be implemented using each package listed above.

For details, please refer to the documentation below.

* [argparse - skcli](./argparse-app/README.md).
